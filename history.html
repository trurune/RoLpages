<li>On July 28, 2012, John Shedletsky confirmed that progress on Roblox on Linux was 97% complete. Shedletsky claimed that the problem with Linux is the poor driver support. Another blog post by Shedletsky claimed that they could spend months on Linux or they could work on a highly requested feature.</li>
<li>Roblox has been tested [Under Wine] multiple times, with success until 2015. On May 15, 2015, Roblox received a "Gold" rating in the Wine App Database.</li>
<li>From 2015 to 2021, it was not possible to run Roblox Player on Linux, as joining a game resulted in the connection being dropped with the error "This game has shut down."</li>
<li>On June 11, 2021, a user by the name of ImSlappy826 created a one-line patch for Wine that allowed the Roblox Player to work again on a GNU/Linux or FreeBSD system. The patch implements the ZwFilterToken function, which was supposed to be implemented along NtFilterToken, into ntdll. The patch has been committed to the Wine development tree.</li>
<li>On January 18, 2022, the Wine development team released Wine version 7.0, bringing the patch to Wine's "Stable" release.</li>
<li>In April 2023, Roblox began the rollout of their new Hyperion anti-cheat system into the Roblox Client, which blocks Wine, therefore making it so that Roblox can no longer be playable on any Linux distro. However, a Roblox admin confirmed that the development team will look into working on Linux/Wine compatibility in the future.</li>
<li>On August 14th, 2023, Roblox began experimenting with bringing back Linux support on their Internal builds of Roblox. Support is hit or miss as some updates break compatibility while others work mostly fine. The client is also a hit or miss and tends to segfault and random times.</li>
<li>As the Wine API evolved its Windows compatibility, they were starting to prove a hazard by 2024. Increased detection of cheating on Wine exposed the exploit to developers, staff and general users. This factor coupled with the floundering of Wine-based Roblox exploits on different Discord/Guilded servers, and the question of maintainability lead to the Roblox staff to yet again block the use of Wine. The blocking update was released on March 2024.</li>
<li>After the anticheat update, users have chosen another way to run Roblox on Linux, through the use of Waydroid, a compatibility layer to run Android apps on a GNU/Linux system, users have reported having success in making the Android version of Roblox work there, however Waydroid requires the Wayland display server to work, which makes it <span style="color:red">impossible</span> to use for users with older NVIDIA GPUs, and has limited support on NVIDIA GPUs in general.
